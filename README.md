# MyAPI

## Running Your SQL File

Create your `SQL` file in your editor (for example, VS Code) and save it with a .sql extension, such as `database.sql`.

Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved your `database.sql` file.

Type `sqlite3` `mydatabase.db` < `database.sql` and press Enter. `SQLite` will create a new SQLite database named `mydatabase.db` and run the SQL commands from the `database.sql` file.

If you want to interact with your database, you can do so by entering the `SQLite` command prompt with sqlite3 `mydatabase.db`.

## Step 2: Model Your Data

You can create a `Models` directory and the corresponding files within your project directory using the terminal and a text editor (like VS Code).


*Step 1*: Open the terminal and navigate to the root directory of your project using the cd command:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
```

*Step 2*: Create a new directory named Models:

```arduino
mkdir Models
```

*Step 3*: Now navigate into the Models directory:

```
cd Models
```

*Step 4*: Create a new file for your Customer model:

```
touch Customer.cs
```

Now you have a `Customer.cs` file in your `Models` directory.

*Step 5*: Open your project in Visual Studio Code:

 ```
/* This command opens VS Code in your project's directory. If VS Code is already open, you can also use the file explorer to navigate to your Models directory and open Customer.cs. */
```
*Step 6*: Now you can input your Customer model code into the Customer.cs file:

```csharp
namespace MyApi.Models
{
    public class Customer
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public string Email { get; set; }
        // other properties...
    }
}
// Don't forget to save your changes in the file. You can repeat these steps to create other model classes.
```




```cs
// Declare a namespace for the project, which helps organize your code and prevent naming conflicts
namespace MyApi.Models
{
    // Declare a public class named 'Customer', which can be accessed by other parts of your application
    public class Customer
    {
        // Declare a public integer property named 'Id'. This will be the unique identifier for each 'Customer' object.
        // 'get; set;' allows this property to be retrieved and changed by other parts of your application
        public int Id { get; set; }

        // Declare a public string property named 'Name'. This will hold the name for each 'Customer' object.
        // 'get; set;' allows this property to be retrieved and changed by other parts of your application
        public string Name { get; set; }

        // Declare a public string property named 'Email'. This will hold the email address for each 'Customer' object.
        // 'get; set;' allows this property to be retrieved and changed by other parts of your application
        public string Email { get; set; }

        // other properties...
    }
}
```

```cs
// Declare a namespace for the project, which helps organize your code and prevent naming conflicts
namespace MyApi.Models
{
    // Declare a public class named 'Customer', which can be accessed by other parts of your application
    public class Customer
    {
        // Declare a public integer property named 'Id'. This will be the unique identifier for each 'Customer' object.
        // 'get; set;' allows this property to be retrieved and changed by other parts of your application
        public int Id { get; set; }

        // Declare a public string property named 'Name'. This will hold the name for each 'Customer' object.
        // 'get; set;' allows this property to be retrieved and changed by other parts of your application
        public string Name { get; set; }

        // Declare a public string property named 'Email'. This will hold the email address for each 'Customer' object.
        // 'get; set;' allows this property to be retrieved and changed by other parts of your application
        public string Email { get; set; }

        // other properties...
    }
}
```

```cs
// Import the necessary libraries
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using MyApi.Models;

// Declare the namespace for the DbContext
namespace MyApi.Data
{
    // Create a class named 'MyContext' that inherits from 'DbContext'
    public class MyContext : DbContext
    {
        // Use a constructor to pass options to the base DbContext
        public MyContext(DbContextOptions<MyContext> options) : base(options)
        {
        }

        // Define a 'DbSet' for each of the entity types that you want to include in your model
        // Here, 'Customers' will be the name of the table in your database
        public DbSet<Customer> Customers { get; set; }
        // Add other DbSets for other models...
    }
}

// This MyContext class is the bridge between your code and the database.
// It maps your Customer model to a Customers table in the database. Remember to add other DbSet properties for your other models.
